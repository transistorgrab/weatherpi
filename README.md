# Weather Pi
This implements a weather station on Raspberry Pi in Pyhton.
The original realization was done on a Raspberry Pi 1B.
After this died for unknown reasons it was continued on a RasPi 3B.

It implements temperature, humidity, air quality (particle count) and wind speed data.
The data is then transmitted to opensensmap.org servers.
